# Opportunity-Insights
This project focuses on the Opportunity Insights Dataset to derive some Economic Information and Social Science

The smart people from Havard published the [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org), where they visualized the Social Mobility across the States. 

This is a super interesting dataset, since it tackles the society and it is also possible to derive some information why some people/ kids have worse outcomes than others. 

This work will try to cluster this data and derive some action plans to have a more equal society.

The work is well described in the Jupyter Notebook, so feel free to just start this one.
