    "\n",
    "The recently published movie [\"The Game Changers\"](https://gamechangersmovie.com) reveals some interesting facts about plant-based diets along with an athlete's performance. The movie shows several world-class athletes, such as Lewis Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger, along with their dieatary habits. Furthermore, the movie backs its hypothesis that a plant-based diet is not only superior to an animal-based diet - including meat, fish, eggs and dairy - with respect to performance, but is also the healthier and environmentally friendlier version. <br /> \n",
    "This controverse movie gained a lot of attention in media with a lot of people arguing against the truth behind this movie along with its shown studies.<br /> \n",
    "The amazing book of [Hans Rosling, Factfulness](https://www.amazon.com/Factfulness-Reasons-World-Things-Better/dp/1250107814), covers the topic of supporting one's opinion with data so that it is not an opinion anymore but a mere fact. Given trustworthy data of the [United Nations (UN)](http://data.un.org) and other [public available and trusted sources](https://ourworldindata.org), such as the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators) and the [Food and Argiculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data), it is possible to retrieve a huge dataset comprising most of the 195 countries around the globe along with some indicators such as alcohol consumptions per capita, GDP per capita, meat consumption per capita and many, many more. <br /> \n",
    "The movie claimed that animal-based diets are causing impaired blood flow, inflammation and an increase in blood pressure. <br /> \n",
    "Since there are (too) many studies mentioned in the movie as well as other studies from the movie's adversaries disagreeing with the movie's hypothesis, this work will try to leverage various datasets from the above mentioned sources to find some correlations in the claims of the movie and its hypothesis. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another indicator that the current diet in developed countries is a mere shitshow is the unfortunate rise of risk for [cancer](https://ourworldindata.org/cancer) and [cardiovascular diseases](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death), which account for a big stake of deaths across the world. <br /> \n",
    "Despite the rise of [public healthcare expenditures](https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare), the risk of getting cancer or a cardiovascular disease nowadays have not dropped and these diseases may even end deadly. <br />\n",
    "Hence, there obviously is a need to scrutinize the current diet along with the healthcare effects on other diseases. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the [life expectancy of Americans dropped the third year in a row](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/life-expectancy-for-american-men-drops-for-a-third-year/), which is also a clear indicator that standard American diet (SAD) or other habits in America are obviously not beneficial for their health. <br /> \n",
    "However, there are other, similiar developed countries such as Japan, Hong Kong or Spain, which still achieve rising life expectancies by an even higher \"base\" life expectancy. <br />\n",
    "Due to the medication, which is supposed to be the same around the world, there need to be other criteria affecting the life expectancy and health. Thus, these cultures have to have a different lifestyle, resulting in different life expectancies. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "This work will focus on the health aspects from the given data and derive conclusions and correlations among several indicator variables and hopefully the importance of food, which in turn can then be used in developing countries to help these folks be more performant. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1) Current Diets\n",
    "\n",
    "The current standard American diet (SAD) consists of over 60% processed foods, such as Bread, Pastries, Sweets, Oil, etc. Another 25% stake is animal products comprising meat, egg, fish and dairy. Hence only 13% are used for Unrefined plant-foods and whole grains. [4],[5] <br /> \n",
    "This diet does not vastly differ from the European diet - unfortunately. The Europeans also get most of their energy from processed foods and animal-based products. <br /> \n",
    "However, there is not one source suggesting one dedicated diet to be the superior among the variety of diets such as ketogenic, low-carb, protein-rich, Paleo or the countless others. Every organization makes different recommendations, but they agree in one point. An ideal diet should account way more in [plant-based products as well as whole grains](https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/resources/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf). [6]<br />\n",
    "Another point to mention is that none of those \"popular\" diets is relinquishing on animal-based products, each of them is suggesting some chicken, steak or fish respectively. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity I will mostly focus on countries that have a similiar Human-development index (HDI), since I assume that these countries have the same access to similiar food products, i.e. in both countries, America and Norway you can buy cinnamon buns or frozen pizza without any problem, however I guess this may not be the case in Kenya or in Congo. <br /> \n",
    "Hence, restricting the analysis on countries with a similiar HDI score may make more sense. \n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no nation only consuming plant-based products, which definitely biases this analysis but still might be a good starting point to compare the most meat consuming countries to the most vegetables consuming countries.<br /> \n",

Back in the days there were no tribes or folks who smoked packs of cigarettes or were obese and definietly didn't suffer from high blood pressure. <br /> \n",
    "This graph is alarming and informative at once - there needed to be some big changes in the modern lifestyle that led to these diseases and accounting for too many deaths that could have been prevented. <br /> \n",
    "According to the *Global Burden of Disease (GBD)* study 4.7 million people died prematurely in 2017 as a result of obesity as well as 10.4 million people from high blood pressure. <br />\n",
    "13% of the entire world adults are obese nowadays and these 4.7 million people could have lived longer if they would have just changed their lifestyle. To put this huge number into context, the deaths from obesity in 2017 was close to four times the number of road accidents. [7] <br /> \n",
    "I claim that four death risks out of the top 5 could be drastically alleviated by just changing the lifestyle of these people suffering from those diseases. <br /> \n",
    "I will try to prove this hypothesis with the help of the datasets. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3) Dataset Representativity\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that this dataset comprises information about the entire country as a whole and its population living there. The studies/ experiments of the movie mostly used a restricted sample size of people across different nations and histories. <br /> \n",
    "To make this point clearer, the dataset takes an average/ stereotype french person, who drinks $x$ liters of wine a year and eats $y$ kg of meat and chesse a year. Moreover, the dataset takes the average of the specific variable, i.e. the Wine consumption per capita is calculated by dividing the sum of Wine sold in the respective country by its population size, disregarding all the masses of tourism in that respective country, which definitely accounts for some liters not being drunk from the french folks. France for example is well-known for its wine consumption - which in fact is remarkable - but considering France being the most attractive destination for travellers, France experienced [438 million tourists in 2018](https://www.thelocal.fr/20190410/peak-year-for-tourists-in-france-despite-yellow-vests-and-rail-strikes), which definitely account for some liters of wine sold and thus the wine consumption statistics can be highly biased due to tourists. <br />\n",
    "However, I still assume that this dataset comprises a representative population out of the countries' citizens. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "To put it in a nutshell, enjoy this work with care, since some datapoints might not be as representative as others and some datapoints might be biased due to tourists coming into the country as well as individuals living in that country, who are the complete opposite of the countries' stereotype. <br /> \n",
    "I know that there is a lot of room for counter arguments, but I try to prove the hypothesis of the movie's authors. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, all the statistics with alcohol (wine, beer, spirits consumptions) was recorded for 15+ year-old citizens in that country. Thus the average will often be lower than the actual consumption in countries like the states where alcohol is only allowed to drink from 21+ years. <br /> "

    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a common and still state-of-the-art used supervised machine learning method, which can even match the performance of simple Neural Networks. <br /> \n",

    "The decision tree structure makes it easy to follow its prediction and also intuitive to understand this technique. <br />\n",
    "Another neat property of Decision Trees are that they can perform both, Regression and Classification tasks. Their functions correspond to those of logistic and linear regression, where the latter is used to predict continous values (Regression) and the former focuses on classifying a specific class (Classification). <br />\n",
    "Since they are so popular and achieved remarkable results, there are many variations/ algorithms for creating these trees. However, the general concept behind those algorithms is the same for each of them. <br /> \n",
    "Most common are Classification and Regression Trees *(CART)*, *ID3* and *C4.5 algorithms*, each of them with their distinctive drawbacks and assets. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea of decision trees is to find descriptive features containing the most information regarding the target. <br />\n",
    "The entire dataset can then be split along the values of these features resulting in an as pure as possible underlying dataset. <br />\n",
    "Hence, it is necessary to determine to most informative features, where the dataset can further be split. <br />\n",
    "This is done by checking all possible features for their so-called information gain. <br /> \n",
    "It counts to use a criterion $i(t)$ that measures how pure the class distribution at node $t$ is. It should either be maximum - if the classes are equally distributed in the node, or minimum (usually 0) - if the node is pure. <br />\n",

    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous part, it is crucial to determine the descriptive features along with their values that split the data best with respect to their true label. <br />\n",
    "The tree is then split based on the nodes, which \"asks questions\" about the underlying dataset, i.e. \"Is the value of this feature smaller than 5\". The data is then split according to the features value, either in the node \"yes, smaller than 5\" (True) or \"no, bigger or equal to 5\" (False). <br />\n",

    "further split the data. The splitting of each branch is performed until a stopping criteria\n",
    "is reached. <br /> \n",
    "Obviously, the Mean-Squared Error (MSE) cannot be used for a criterion to make the splits since it only measures how far apart the prediction and the true value is. The classification trees utilize the Classification Error Rate. <br />\n",

    "Random forest has one additional stochastic element to it. In addition to bootstrapping the data sets, only a randomly selected subset of features are considered at each step of the building. This is done to counteract possible correlations of the features in the data set, as these features may not coexist in many trees. <br /> \n",
    "This will result in a so-called *ensemble* of different trees, which all describe the data differently to some degree. <br /> \n",
    "Since the *wisdom of the crowd* usually achieves outstanding results, the idea behind random forests is that the average of all those trees will yield a great performance and a low-variance result. <br />\n",
    "The size of the subset of features is a hyperparameter that can be tweaked, but a good starting point for the size of the subset of features is $m = p$, where p is the size of the full set [8]. <br />\n",
    "Once the forest is created, it can be used to classify new samples from unseen query instances. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sample is then propagated through every tree in the forest, each giving its own prediction. The\n",
    "predictions for each class aggregate and thus, the class with the highest count is\n",
    "deemed \"the winner\" according to the principles of majority voting. <br /> \n",
    "Since each tree in the forest is different from one another, obtaining the averaged result of the forest is more likely to be the truth value rather than a single decision tree. <br />\n",
    "Hence, one can expect a random forest to generally perform better than single trees. The \"bootstrapped\" nature of forests also makes them perform comparably well on sparse data. <br /> \n",
    "However, random forests are still prone to perform quite bad when subjected to skewed data sets, as the bootstraping may cause the sparsely represented classes to appear even less, resulting in a poorly representation in the forest. \n",

    "The previous Section dealt with the Backpropagation and Gradient descent. However, to calculate a proper gradient, we utilize an activation function $f_l(x)$. In order to introduce non-linearities so that the model can also represent complex datasets, employing a non-linear activation function is essential. <br /> \n",
    "It is required that these functions are continous and differentiable in order for the backpropagation to work. [1] <br >\n",

    "Looking at Fig. 3, one can see that the functions on the left hand-side (Sigmoid, tanh and ReLU) are only constant on a specific interval. For instance ReLU is 0 before the origin and then linearly increasing, tanh and sigmoid are only differentiable in an interval from approximately [-3, 3]. <br /> Thus, those activation functions could squeeze the input to 0 beyond the intervals, i.e. a fully saturated neuron with input $z_j >> 1$, or a dead neuron with input $z_j << -1$ will exhibit very small gradients or none at all. Resulting in wasted neurons, since they cannot learn anything. [9]\n",
    "To avoid this problem, it is important to initialize the weights and biases correctly. One method to initialize the weights and biases is the [Xavier initialization](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf).

    "## Dataset\n",

    "The following work will focus on datasets retrieved from *[United Nations (UN)](http://data.un.org)*, *[World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators)* as well as *[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data)*. Several files have been downloaded and merged together into one huge file of the datapoints. All the file cover mostly the same countries with different indicators, such as Cancer death rates, Vegetable consumption, GDP per capita, Life expectancy and many more. Most of these indicators are even tracked over several years, resulting in a huge dataset. <br /> \n",
    "However, since the dataset I want to work with comprises multiple single files, merging those is essential. Due to the fact that the following work is trusting this merged dataset, it is important to validate the data as well as prepare and process those in the proper manner. Since the datasets were created by different persons within that organization, sometimes the country names differ, i.e. in one list *Hong Kong* might be recorded like that but in another list it shows up as *China, Hong Kong SAR*, same with *Macao* or *Taiwan*. Likewise for *United States of America*, which can show up in too many different synonyms. Thus, this could end in a disaster, if the files are not processed before, since the data is not corresponding to the real, recorded values. <br /> \n",
    "There is an [extra notebook](https://github.com/lenlehm/Opportunity-Insights/blob/master/Create_Dataset.ipynb), which only takes care of the preprocessing and that everyone can follow my implementation strategies for merging the lists into one *Masterlist*. <br /> \n",
    "Furhtermore, there you will see that I defined a set of countries I am interested in, 196 countries in total, which counts to rename as a first step of preprocessing to ensure data consistency. <br /> \n",
    "In order to save computation and memory, the states which are not listed in the respective file will get deleted to reduce the size of the files. <br />\n",
    "Once the dataset is created, we have 197 countries with several indicators over the different years, resulting in a dataset matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1918 \\times 197}$. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the interest in the actual values and more interpretability in those I decided against standardization or normalization of the dataset. It would definitely help for the Classification and Regression Analysis for the respective Machine Learning algorithm, but since the focus of this work is on the analysis of the data, there will be no normalization or standardization. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are mostly two common techniques: **Min-Max Normalization**, as well as **Standardization**. However, when the minimum and maximum values are not known in the features, it is obviously not possible to apply the first technique, which reads as follows: <br /> \n",

The \"bend\" is considered where the value does not decrease as much as it did before, hence in our case 5 is the optimal number of clusters according to the Elbow method. <br />"

    "\n",
    "One thing that straight catches the eye is how sensitive the neural network is to small parameter changes. All the parameters that have been changed in the above cells are called *hyperparameters*. <br /> \n",
    "Those are all the parameters that determine the succesand performance of the neural network like not only learning rate, regularization strength, activation functions, but also batch size, number of epochs and so on, which have not greatly been modified above due to time restrictions. <br />\n",
    "Furthermore, looking across all the different datasets one can see that the data preparation also takes a (big) stake for the model's performance, depending on which activation functions are being used (some could end up in vanishing or exploding gradients). <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, Fig. 6, which shows the effects of a changing leraning rates $\\tau$ did not end up being the desired end result. Usually $\\tau$ is very critical for the success of learning and also convergence. <br />\n",
    "If the learning rate $\\tau$ is too small, it takes years until it converges (if enough epochs are set). If the learning rate $\\tau$ is too high, the algotihm can't converge at all, since it is only bouncing around and not resulting in a (global) optimum. [8] <br />\n",
    "Fig. 7 displays the effects of the regularization strength $\\lambda$.\n",
    "Whe $\\lambda$ is too high, the algorithm is penalzing too much ending up in a bad model and thus bad accuracy. Obviously, if $\\lambda$ is too low it is like not penalzing at all and thus also getting a bad model with a bad accuracy score, if there are inconsistencies in the dataset, where regularization would be needed. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on to the last cell, where only the activation function was changed to a *tanh* activation instead of *ReLU*. <br /> \n",
    "The accuracy experienced a massive drop of almost 57%. Coming from almost 78% for a *ReLU* network with the same shape and size to 21%. Due to vanishing and exploding gradients, the network ends up not learning anything. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Those are just some few out of many parameters in a neural networks to tune. There are multiple more, like batch size, number of epochs, number of hidden layers, number of neurons, choice of optimizer and so on. <br /> \n",
    "Hence, one can conclude that neural networks are really sensitive to parameter changes along with a tedious search for optimal hyperparameters. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "When considering Logistic Regression in the beginning of this work, there were similiar results achieved without having to tune some critical parameters. <br /> \n",
    "Moreover, Logistic Regression's accuracy basically stayed the same even when changing its regularization parameter $\\lambda$, which makes it even more robust compared to the sensitive neural networks. <br />\n",
    "Due to its simplicity in implementation, faster convergence and no tedious hyperparameter search Logistic Regression should prefered over Neural Networks for this dataset. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is to mention that when properly tuning the Neural Network hyperparameters with Bayesian Analysis [3], it is possible to further boost the Neural Network's accuracy, however this comes to the cost of a more complex implementation as well as computational power and time (= both of which I do not have). <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, when comparing the results to Yeh et al. [4] it is great to see that they achieved similiar results. Since they do not state, which kind of data preprocessing they utilized for their work and also did not clarify their train and test data split, some deviations are naturally, especially when considering that they most probably had different samples compared to mine in their test dataset even if they utilized a 20% split. <br />\n",
    "Nevertheless, the results are quite similiar with the same conclusion that Neural Networks are in terms of accuracy slightly better but not with respect to the implementation and searching complexity of these beasts. (Happy troubleshooting by the way - cost me like 2 days to find a small little bug) <br />"

    "As mentioned in the theoretical part of Neural Networks, they can either be used for Regression or Classification (as done above). The Classification utilizes the cross entropy, equation (30), as a loss function. The neat benefit of the cross-entropy loss is that it is a convex function, meaning a local minimum is also automatically a global minimum. This is awesome for our minimization problem, since it is sure to find the global minimum of our function and thus the best result. <br /> \n",
    "In classification there is a very particular set of possible output values, the possibles classes. Hence, Mean-Squared Error (MSE), equation (29), is badly defined, as it does not have this kind of knowledge and in turn penalizes errors in an incompatible way. However, in Regression where the goal is to predict a continuous value, MSE gives a great indicator how far apart the predicted value to the true value is. <br />"

    "Taken into account that my Notebook has limited computing power - Intel Core i7, 7th generation, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD - there was the bare minimum of hyperparameter search done for both Neural Nets and XGBoost. <br />\n",

    "This work has shown some interesting facts about life expectancy and still has a lot more potential. However, to leverage the entire, irrepressible power of the UN, FAO and WHO datasets, it would be amazing to even add more indicator variables to the dataset. There are so many more interesting recordings on their websites such as *machinery usage*, *producer prices* or *air pollution*. Due to the lack of time, I was not able to incorporate those into my dataset. <br /> \n",
    "Furthermore, it would be a great to analyze countries with a similiar human development index (HDI) and further derive conclusions about the differences among those \"similiar\" countries. Using multiple datasets, splitted according to the HDI, would not only speed up the findings due to reduced computational power, but is also more transparent and eases the analysis task. <br />\n",
    "Comparing similiar developed countries can then be used to derive insights why states are performing better than others and in turn help those \"weaker\" countries to become stronger. <br /> \n",
    "There is still a lot of potential hidden in the data, I restricted myself to the nutrition/ life expectancy topics, but there are so many different questions which can be answered with the help of these amazing datasets of national organizations. <br /> \n",
    "Making full use of these datasets, it is possible to further reduce poverty, increase the overall human development index as well as the happiness of each individual by sharing the insights with the policy makers and foundations. <br />\n",
    "Thus, it is important to spread the word of the existence of such great datasets."
