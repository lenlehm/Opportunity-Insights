    "## 1.) Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The recently published movie [\"The Game Changers\"](https://gamechangersmovie.com) reveals some interesting facts about plant-based diets along with an athlete's performance. The movie shows several world-class athletes, such as Lewis Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger, along with their dieatary habits. Furthermore, the movie backs its hypothesis that a plant-based diet is not only superior to an animal-based diet - including meat, fish, eggs and dairy - with respect to performance, but is also the healthier and environmentally friendlier version. <br /> \n",
    "This controverse movie gained a lot of attention in media with a lot of people arguing against the truth behind this movie along with its shown studies.<br /> \n",
    "The amazing book of [Hans Rosling, Factfulness](https://www.amazon.com/Factfulness-Reasons-World-Things-Better/dp/1250107814), covers the topic of supporting one's opinion with data so that it is not an opinion anymore but a mere fact. Given trustworthy data of the [United Nations (UN)](http://data.un.org) and other [public available and trusted sources](https://ourworldindata.org) it is possible to retrieve a huge dataset comprising most of the countries around the globe along with some special indicators such as alcohol consumptions per capita, GDP per capita, meat consumption per capita and many, many more. <br /> \n",
    "The movie claimed that animal-based diets are causing impaired blood flow and inflammation. <br /> \n",
    "Another indicator that the current diet in developed countries is a mere shitshow is the unfortunate rise of risk for [cancer](https://ourworldindata.org/cancer) and [cardiovascular diseases](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death), which account for a big stake of deaths across the developed countries. <br /> \n",
    "Since there are (too) many studies mentioned in the movie as well as other studies from the movie's adversaries disagreeing with the movie's hypothesis, this work will try to use the dataset from the UN across the entire world to find some correlations in the claims of the movie and its hypothesis and likewise for the adversaries arguments. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the rise of [public healthcare expenditures](https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare), the risk of getting cancer or a cardiovascular disease nowadays have not dropped yet and these diseases may even end deadly. <br />\n",
    "Hence, there obviously is a need to scrutinize the current diet along with the healthcare effects on other diseases. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, that the [life expectancy of Americans dropped the third year in a row](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/life-expectancy-for-american-men-drops-for-a-third-year/) is also a clear indicator that standard American diet or other habits are obviously not beneficial for their health. <br /> \n",
    "However, there are other, similiar developed countries such as Japan, Hong Kong or Spain, which still achieve rising life expectancies by an even higher \"base\" life expectancy. Due to the medication, which is supposed to be the same around the world, there need to be other criteria affecting the life expectancy and health respectively. Thus, these cultures have to have a different lifestyle, resulting in different life expectancies. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "This work will focus on the health aspects from the given data and derive conclusions and correlations among several indicator variables and hopefully the importance of food, which in turn can then be used in developing countries to help these folks be more performant and not fall in the same shithole we currently are at. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "DATA IS TAKEN FROM UN, WHO and [FAO](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1) Current Diets\n",
    "\n",
    "The current standard American diet (SAD) consits of over 60% processed foods, such as Bread, Pastries, Sweets, Oil, etc. Another 25% stake is animal products comprising meat, egg, fish and dairy. Hence only 13% are used for Unrefined plant-foods and whole grains. [4] <br /> \n",
    "This diet does not vastly differ from the European diet - unfortunately. The Europeans also get most of their energy from processed foods and animal-based products. <br /> \n",
    "However, there is not one source which always suggests/ recommends one specific food intake. Every organization makes different recommendations, but they agree in one point. An ideal diet should account way more in [plant-based products as well as whole grains](https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/resources/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf). [6] **SOURCE**<br />\n",
    "#### CHECK ME AGAIN\n",
    "Thus, analyzing the dietary behavior of the countries is a good starting point in terms of enhancing life expectancy. <br /> \n",
    "Naturally, there is almost no nation with same medical standards, which is mostly focused on eating plant-based foods. This makes the analysis way harder and there is definitely a room for improvement. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1) Dataset Representativity\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that this dataset comprises information about the entire country as a whole and its population living there, where the studies of the movie mostly used a restricted sample size of people across different nations and histories. <br /> \n",
    "To make this point clearer, the dataset takes an average/ stereotype french person, who drinks $x$ liters of wine a year and eats $y$ kg of meat a year. Moreover, the dataset takes the average of the specific variable, i.e. the Wine consumption per capita is calculated by dividing the sum of Wine sold in the respective country by its population size, disregarding all the masses of tourism in that respective country, which definitely accounts for some liters not being drunk from the french folks. France for example is well-known for its wine consumption - which in fact is remarkable - but considering France being the most attractive destination for travellers, France experienced [438 million tourists in 2018](https://www.thelocal.fr/20190410/peak-year-for-tourists-in-france-despite-yellow-vests-and-rail-strikes), which definitely account for some liters of wine sold and thus the wine consumption statistics can be highly biased due to tourists. <br />\n",
    "However, I still assume that this dataset comprises a representative population out of the countries' citizens. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "To put it in a nutshell, enjoy this work with care, since some datapoints might not be as representative than others and some datapoints might be biased due to tourists coming into the country as well as individuals living in that country, who are the complete opposite of this countries stereotype. <br /> \n",
    "I know that there is a lot of room for counter arguments, but I try to prove the hypothesis of the movie's authors. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All the statistics with alcohol (wine, beer, spirits consumptions) was recorded for 15+ year-old citizens in that country. Thus the average will often be lower than the actual consumption in countries like the states where alcohol is only allowed to drink from 21+ years. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2) Personal Notes ??!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Having lived in America for 1 year and in Japan for 6 months, I got a feeling for the people and their culture. <br /> \n",
    "One thing that I experienced while living in these developed countries is that the Japanese are mostly taking their feet and trains to work or also for leisure time activities. <br />\n",
    "The Americans in contrast use their car for literally 100 m - or how they would put it - 100 ft to get anywhere. <br /> \n",
    "Most of the Americans however are insanely sporty during their high school and college time, unfortunately they lose this habit when start wokring and barely move anymore. <br /> \n",
    "The Japanese do not do a lot of sport, but they actually walk more than the other countries. <br /> \n",
    "Another factor for sure is the dietary habits. Japanese tend to eat a lot of Fish, Meat and Rice with vegetables. The Americans on the other side are well-known for their burgers and fatty diets. <br /> \n"

    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a common and still state-of-the-art used supervised machine learning method, which can even match the performance of simple Neural Networks. <br /> \n",
    "The biggest advantage is that they are very interpretable while a neural network is more like a black box, where it is often not easy to understand what exactly happend in between the (hidden) layers. <br />\n",
    "The decision tree structure makes it easy to follow its prediction and also intuitive to understand this technique. <br />\n",
    "Another neat property of Decision Trees are that they can perform both, Regression and Classification tasks. Their functions correspond to those of logistic and linear regression, where the latter is used to predict continous values (Regression) and the former focuses on classifying a specific class (Classification). <br />\n",
    "Since they are so popular and achieved remarkable results, there are many variations/ algorithms for creating these trees. However, the general concept behind those algorithms is the same for each of them. <br /> \n",
    "Most common are Classification and Regression Trees *(CART)*, *ID3* and *C4.5 algorithms*, each of them with their distinctive drawbacks and assets. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea of decision trees is to find descriptive features containing the most information regarding the target. <br />\n",
    "The entire dataset can then be split along the values of these features resulting in an as pure as possible underlying dataset. <br />\n",
    "Hence, it is necessary to determine to most informative features, where the dataset can further be split. <br />\n",
    "This is done by checking all possible features for their so-called information gain. <br /> \n",
    "It counts to use a criterion $i(t)$ that measures how pure the class distribution at node $t$ is. It should either be maximum - if the classes are equally distributed in the node, or minimum (usually 0) - if the node is pure. <br />\n",

    "Obviously the Mean-Squared Error (MSE) cannot be used for a criterion to make the splits. The classification trees utilize the Classification Error Rate. <br />\n",

    "This will result in a so-called *ensemble* of different trees, which all describe the data differently to some degree. <br /> \n",

    "Since each tree in the forest is different from one another, obtaining the averaged result of the forest is more likely to be the truth value rather than a single decision tree. <br />\n",
    "Hence, one can expect a random forest to generally perform better than single trees. The \"bootstrapped\" nature of forests also makes them perform comparably well on sparse data. <br /> \n",
    "However, random forests are still prone to perform quite bad when subjected to skewed data sets, as the bootstraping may cause the sparsely represented classes to appear even less, resulting in a poorly representation in the forest. \n",

Due to the fact that the following work is trusting this merged dataset, it is important to validate the data as well as prepare and process those in the proper manner. Since the datasets were created by different persons within that organization, sometimes the country names differ, i.e. in one list *Hong Kong* might be recorded like that but in another list it shows up as *China, Hong Kong SAR*, same with *Macao* or *Taiwan*. Likewise for *United States of America*, which can show up in too many different synonyms. Thus, this could end in a disaster, if the files are not processed before, since the data is not corresponding to the real, recorded values. <br /> \n",
    "There is an [extra notebook](https://github.com/lenlehm/Opportunity-Insights/blob/master/Create_Dataset.ipynb), which only takes care of the preprocessing and that everyone can follow my implementation strategies for merging the lists into one *Masterlist*. <br /> \n",
    "Furhtermore, there you will see that I defined a set of countries I am interested in, 196 countries in total, which counts to rename as a first step of preprocessing to ensure data consistency. <br /> \n",
    "In order to save computation and memory, the states which are not listed in the respective file will get deleted to reduce the size of the files. <br />\n",
    "Once the dataset is created, we have 196 countries with several indicators over the different years, resulting in a dataset matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{10.000 \\times 196}$. <br />\n",

    "### TODO \n",
    "When taking a closer look to the dataset at hand, one can notice that there are only numerical columns, so there are no written words in any of the columns, and every column is filled with a proper value, which is usually never the case for other datasets. <br />\n",
    "Furthermore, the numeric values vastly range from binary values like *sex (1 = male, 2 = female)* over *age ([21, ..., 79])* until *payment amount ([0, ..., 1.684.259])*. Hence there is a need of normalizing the entire dataset to decrease the variance in our model as well as being suitable for our activation functions (see Chapter \"Vanishing and Exploding Gradients\"). <br /> \n",
    "There are mostly two common techniques: **Min-Max Normalization**, as well as **Standardization**. However, when the minimum and maximum values are not known in the features, it is obviously not possible to apply the first technique, which reads as follows: <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x' = \\frac{x - \\min{(x)}}{\\max{(x)} - \\min{(x)}}. \\tag{42}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation (42) squeezes all the values in the respective column to a range from [0, ..., 1]. Additionally to the aforementioned problem, considerable outliers will affect this method greatly, where the outlier takes either the value $1$ when being the biggest value or $0$ when it is super small.  <br /> \n",
    "That is the reason why this work makes use of *Standardization*: <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x' = \\frac{x - \\bar{x}}{\\sigma_x}, \\tag{43}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bar{x}$ is the mean/ average value of the feature vector and $\\sigma{x}$ is its standard deviation. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional to the findings above, this dataset is also heavily unbalanced: It has almost by a factor of 5 more samples labeled as $0$, which means no default. Only 22.12% (6.636 out of the 30.000) samples are default samples. In order to not have a biased classifier, this work uses *undersampling* as technique of balancing the dataset, i.e. picking randomly the same amount of the minority class (in our case 6.636). Since using *oversampling* would not work due to the complexity and variances in the dataset, there is no way of upsampling the minority class to the size of the majority class. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, when comparing the documentation of the dataset with the dataset itself, one can identify mismatches in the documentation and the actual dataset. The documentation states that the features *Education* as well as *Marriage* have ranges from $[1, 2, 3, 4]$ and $[1, 2, 3]$, respectively. <br > \n",
    "However, the dataset yields values of $0, 5$ and $6$ as well. Meaning that these values are not documented and probably have been wrongly labeled. One common way is to declare these non-documented values as *NaN* values and deleting these entries. Unfortunately, we would only keep $13.5\\%$ of the initial dataset (4.061 out of 30.000). Obviously this is too much data, which is being lost when applying this method. I decided to declare all the non-documented values as a sepearate class. Hence, *Marriage* is not going to change since there was only one different, non-documented value. *Education* however, is getting another label, $5$, representing the new label *unknown*."

    "### Analysis of the classification task\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that straight catches the eye is how sensitive the neural network is to small parameter changes. All the parameters that have been changed in the above cells are called *hyperparameters*. <br /> \n",
    "Those are all the parameters that determine the succesand performance of the neural network like not only learning rate, regularization strength, activation functions, but also batch size, number of epochs and so on, which have not greatly been modified above due to time restrictions. <br />\n",
    "Furthermore, looking across all the different datasets one can see that the data preparation also takes a (big) stake for the model's performance, depending on which activation functions are being used (some could end up in vanishing or exploding gradients). <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, Fig. 6, which shows the effects of a changing leraning rates $\\tau$ did not end up being the desired end result. Usually $\\tau$ is very critical for the success of learning and also convergence. <br />\n",
    "If the learning rate $\\tau$ is too small, it takes years until it converges (if enough epochs are set). If the learning rate $\\tau$ is too high, the algotihm can't converge at all, since it is only bouncing around and not resulting in a (global) optimum. [8] <br />\n",
    "Fig. 7 displays the effects of the regularization strength $\\lambda$.\n",
    "Whe $\\lambda$ is too high, the algorithm is penalzing too much ending up in a bad model and thus bad accuracy. Obviously, if $\\lambda$ is too low it is like not penalzing at all and thus also getting a bad model with a bad accuracy score, if there are inconsistencies in the dataset, where regularization would be needed. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on to the last cell, where only the activation function was changed to a *tanh* activation instead of *ReLU*. <br /> \n",
    "The accuracy experienced a massive drop of almost 57%. Coming from almost 78% for a *ReLU* network with the same shape and size to 21%. Due to vanishing and exploding gradients, the network ends up not learning anything. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Those are just some few out of many parameters in a neural networks to tune. There are multiple more, like batch size, number of epochs, number of hidden layers, number of neurons, choice of optimizer and so on. <br /> \n",
    "Hence, one can conclude that neural networks are really sensitive to parameter changes along with a tedious search for optimal hyperparameters. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "When considering Logistic Regression in the beginning of this work, there were similiar results achieved without having to tune some critical parameters. <br /> \n",
    "Moreover, Logistic Regression's accuracy basically stayed the same even when changing its regularization parameter $\\lambda$, which makes it even more robust compared to the sensitive neural networks. <br />\n",
    "Due to its simplicity in implementation, faster convergence and no tedious hyperparameter search Logistic Regression should prefered over Neural Networks for this dataset. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is to mention that when properly tuning the Neural Network hyperparameters with Bayesian Analysis [3], it is possible to further boost the Neural Network's accuracy, however this comes to the cost of a more complex implementation as well as computational power and time (= both of which I do not have). <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, when comparing the results to Yeh et al. [4] it is great to see that they achieved similiar results. Since they do not state, which kind of data preprocessing they utilized for their work and also did not clarify their train and test data split, some deviations are naturally, especially when considering that they most probably had different samples compared to mine in their test dataset even if they utilized a 20% split. <br />\n",
    "Nevertheless, the results are quite similiar with the same conclusion that Neural Networks are in terms of accuracy slightly better but not with respect to the implementation and searching complexity of these beasts. (Happy troubleshooting by the way - cost me like 2 days to find a small little bug) <br />"

    "### Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the theoretical part of Neural Networks, they can either be used for Regression or Classification (as done above). The Classification utilizes the cross entropy, equation (30), as a loss function. The neat benefit of the cross-entropy loss is that it is a convex function, meaning a local minimum is also automatically a global minimum. This is awesome for our minimization problem, since it is sure to find the global minimum of our function and thus the best result. <br /> \n",
    "In classification there is a very particular set of possible output values, the possibles classes. Hence, Mean-Squared Error (MSE), equation (29), is badly defined, as it does not have this kind of knowledge and in turn penalizes errors in an incompatible way. However, in Regression where the goal is to predict a continuous value, MSE gives a great indicator how far apart the predicted value to the true value is. <br />"

    "This work expanded on Logistic Regression and Neural Networks, especially Multi-Layered Perceptrons (MLP). <br />\n",
    "As seen in the first part of this work, where credit card data has been successfully classified, MLP slightly outperformed Logistic Regression, but took longer to converge along with a tedious hyperparameter search. <br /> \n",
    "Taken into account that my Notebook has limited computing power - Intel Core i7, 7th generation, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD - there was the bare minimum of hyperparameter search done for the MLP. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters are essential parameters to this algorihtm, which need to be tuned to end up in an optimal solution. These hyperparameters include the learning rate $\\tau$, batch sizes, regularization parameter $\\lambda$, amount of hidden layers, amount of neurons within each layer, activation functions, epochs and optimizer (SGD or Adam). <br /> \n",
    "Hence, there is even more potential for MLP with the given credit card dataset, when performing a hyperparameter search by using either random search or Bayesian Analysis. [3] <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion Logistic Regression is to be prefered for this classification dataset due to its simplicity and time benefits by almost the same accuracy. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "The neat benefit of neural networks is that they are also useful for Regression tasks, as shown in the second part of the project. By only changing the Loss function from Cross Entropy to MSE, the same algorithm can now predict a continuous value as seen in the terrain dataset above. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the Neural Network as a regressor to the common regression methods such as Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge and Lasso Regression, one can tell that the common regression methods, especially OLS and Ridge Regression achieved remarkably good results (see the Table four cells above). <br />\n",
    "Nevertheless, the neural network still outperformed both of those Regression methods, since it can model even more complex shapes. <br />\n",

    "## 5.) Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This work shows that it is possible to derive some information about the correlation about life expectancy and nutrition even on a country based filter. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "**There are some countries building clusters and are thus similiar with respect to the dataset we have at hand.**\n",
    "\n",
    "** WRITE SOMETHING ABOUT CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION **\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that these results have to be seen critically, since there is a lot of bias in the data due to tourism and other external factors that might affect the recordings of some values. <br />"

    "## 6.) Further Work \n",
    "\n",
    "This work has shown some interesting facts about life expectancy and still has a lot more potential. However, to leverage the entire, irrepressible power of the UN, FAO and WHO datasets, it would be amazing to even add more indicator variables to the dataset. There are so many more interesting recordings on their websites such as *machinery usage*, *producer prices* or *air pollution*. Due to the lack of time, I was not able to incorporate those into my dataset. <br /> \n",
    "Furthermore, it would be a great to analyze countries with a similiar human development index (HDI) and further derive conclusions about the differences among those \"similiar\" countries. Using multiple datasets, splitted according to the HDI, would not only speed up the findings due to reduced computational power, but is also more transparent and eases the analysis task. <br />\n",
    "Comparing similiar developed countries can then be used to derive insights why states are performing better than others and in turn help those \"weaker\" countries to become stronger. <br /> \n",
    "There is still a lot of potential hidden in the data, I restricted myself to the nutrition/ life expectancy topics, but there are so many different questions which can be answered with the help of these amazing datasets of national organizations. <br /> \n",
    "Making full use of these datasets, it is possible to further reduce poverty, increase the overall human development index as well as the happiness of each individual by sharing the insights with the policy makers and foundations. <br />\n",
    "Thus, it is important to spread the word of the existence of such great datasets."
