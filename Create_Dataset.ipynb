    "## DATASET CREATION\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the dataset I will work with does not come as one already done dataset - as it is mostly usual in Data Science projects. <br /> \n",
    "To get the sheer experience of how a normal Data Science job looks like I also wanted to dive into this issue. By experience I can tell that this takes a shit ton of time - like almost 80% - of preparing the data. <br /> \n",
    "Since the data usually shares the same countries and lists mostly the same years of the recording I used this as a primary key where I connect the datapoints with each other. <br /> \n",
    "However, the  countries are listed in rows along with the year of the recording - I want to have a final dataset that looks like follows: <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "|Country | Afghanistan | Albania | ... | Zimbabwe | \n",
    "| ----- | ----------  | ------ | ----- | ------- | \n",
    "|Alcohol consumption [l] | 0.2 | 2.4 | ... | 0.01 |\n",
    "|Human Develpment Index (HDI) | 0.1 | 0.15 | ... | 0.1 | \n",
    "|... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n",
    "|Healthcare Expenditure [$] | 13.322 | 15.211 | ... | 1.039 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, I have to transpose each of the countries and record each of the years as seperate entry in the dataset. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "All the data is [publicly available](https://ourworldindata.org), and this source is trusted by many notorious companies such as Vox, The Ney York times and even the top universities of this world like MIT, Oxford, Stanford. <br /> \n",
    "Hence, I assume that this data is rather based on actual recording from the respective country. <br /> \n",
    "Even the United Nation published their records in this page and I bet that these folks do some amazing work, which we can trust. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "I downloaded 76lists with different indicator variables ranging from the Human Developemnt Index (HDI) over the life expectancy until poultry consumption per capita for several years. Hence there is a lot of data in it and I am just sratching the surface of these datasets of the UN, WHO and FAO. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing to mention with respect to the countries is that some of them were only listed together such as *Serbia and Montenegro*, *Belgium Luxembourg*, ... and thus sometimes there is no single value for these countries available due to their combined listing. I decided not to give the credits only one specific country due to the unproportionality in their population and possibly cultural changes. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "But now let's not waste too much with the explaination part and go straight into how I merged the datafiles to one huge on. <br /> "
